        stroganoff in a one-pan version. The ultimate comfort food with flavorful ground beef, 
        mushrooms, and egg noodles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vodka (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups egg noodles</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh sliced chives or green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, season with salt, 
            and saute, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. 
            Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring, until meat is browned and crumbly, and onions 
            turn soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with black pepper and cayenne.</li>
        <li>Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute. Pour in vodka and allow to 
            evaporate, about 30 seconds. Stir in beef broth and water and bring to a simmer. Cook, 
            stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and simmer for 
            5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until noodles are just 
            tender, about 3 minutes. (See Cook's Note.)</li>
        <li>Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream. Serve immediately 
            with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
    <p>Cooking time may vary based on which brand and shape of egg noodle you use. If pan gets too 
        dry before noodles are cooked through, add more broth.</p>
